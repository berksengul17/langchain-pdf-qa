The dis -\\ncussion fostered two position pa -\\npers written by two of the specialty \\ngroup members: Jeremy Crampton \\nwas pro, and Keith Clarke was con. \\nThe name of the specialty group \\nwas never changed, but the forces \\nbehind visualization remained. \\nRelax, I do not intent to resur -\\nrect that discussion here (is that a \\ncollective sigh of relief I heard?). \\nWhat I wanted to talk about here \\nare some discussions we’ve had in \\nour department regarding courses, \\nand the names of proposed cours -\\nes.

While \\nexploring the reasons for its composition, we examine the poem’s debts \\nto Old and Middle English poetry as well as to medieval world maps \\nknown as mappaemundi , especially those made in England prior to \\n1\\x1800 . But Birney took only so much from these maps. In search of more \\nelusive inspirations, both cartographic and otherwise, we uncover other \\nsources: Anglo-Saxon poems never before associated with “Mappe -\\nmounde,” maps from the Age of Discovery and beyond, concealed \\ndetails of Birney’s personal life. Then we trace Birney’s long-standing \\ninterest in geography and exploration to show how he used maps, espe -\\ncially mappaemundi , as visual metaphors for his intellectual, spiritual, \\nand personal life.\\nKeywords: Poetry about Maps, Medieval World Maps/ Mappaemundi , \\nMedieval Poetry, Renaissance Maps,  Moby Dick .\\narle Birney was one of Canada’s most beloved writers and public \\nfigures, a man whose life spanned most of the twentieth century from \\n1904 to 1995. Among his finest poems is “Mappemounde,” written in 1945 \\nwhen Birney was forty-one. This paper introduces “Mappemounde,” then \\nexplores the poem’s inspirations and analogues—literary as well as carto-\\ngraphic. These range from Anglo-Saxon poetry and Herman Melville’s \\nMoby Dick to medieval mappaemundi  and maps from the Age of Discovery. \\nOur survey reveals not only the complexity of “Mappemounde” but the \\ndegree to which Birney uses medieval world maps as  visual metaphors for \\nhis life and the world he knew.\\nEarle Birney’s “Mappemounde”\\nNo not this old   whalehall can whelm us\\nshiptamed gullgraced   soft to our glidings\\nHarrows that mere more   which squares our map\\nSee in its north   where scribe has marked mermen\\nshore-sneakers who croon   to the seafarer’s girl\\nnext year’s gleewords   East and west nadders\\nflamefanged bale-twisters   their breath dries up tears\\nchars in the breast-hoard   the brave picture-faces\\nSouthward Cetegrande  that   sly beast who sucks in\\nwith whirlwind also   the wanderer’s pledges\\nThat sea is hight Time   it hems all hearts’ landtrace\\nMen say the redeless   reaching its bounds\\ntopple in maelstrom   tread back never\\nAdread in that mere   we drift toward map’s end\\n Line 1.  “Whalehall”: i.e., “the sea” (Birney 1972, 85)1\\n Line 3. “Mere”: Old English, “the sea”\\n Line 6. “Gleewords”: Old English gliwword , “song” (Jakes 1979, \\n73)         “ Nadders ”: Old English naedre , “adder,” “serpent,”', metadata={'source': '/home/berk/Downloads/pkpadmin,+529-2711-1-CE.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

After treatment in an English military hospital, he was \\nawaiting his return on the hospital ship El Nil , when he overheard Cana -\\ndian soldiers and their English girlfriends pledge eternal love. Wonder -\\ning how many promises would be broken by distance and time, Birney \\ncomposed “Mappemounde” as he sailed west over the Atlantic. About a \\nseafarer’s ill-fated struggle to cross the ocean of medieval world maps, \\n“Mappemounde” laments the ephemerality of love, fidelity, and life itself \\n(Birney 1972, 86; Aichinger 1979, 76-78).\\nBirney would later credit World War II with making him a poet (Davey \\n1971, 20-21). He received his first prestigious Governor General’s Award \\nfor poetry in 1942. The second came in 1945, the year he wrote “Mappe -\\nmounde.” Three years later, Birney placed the poem immediately after the \\none opening his third collection of poetry, The Strait of Anian  (Birney 1948, \\n4). Since then, “Mappemounde” has been heavily anthologized. Acknowl -\\nedging its importance, Birney included revised versions in his Selected \\nPoems 1940-1966 (Birney 1966, 90), Ghost in the Wheels  (Birney 1977b, 34), \\nand the Collected Poems of Earle Birney , from which our text derives.2 (The \\nCollected Poems of Earle Birney by Earle Birney, 2 vols., Toronto: McClelland \\nand Stewart, 1975,  1:92.

An academic as well as \\na poet, Birney had received his doctorate in English from the University of \\nToronto in 1936 and taught there before serving overseas. After the war, he \\nwent on to teach medieval literature and creative writing at the University \\nof British Columbia (1946-1965). There, he regularly offered courses on Old \\nEnglish and Geoffrey Chaucer, who was the subject of both his dissertation \\nand a book of essays on irony (Birney 1985).

But the names of the cardinal direc -\\ntions, the adverbial suffix “-ward,” and the strong, monosyllabic verbs \\n“suck,” “hem,” “tread,” and “drift” all betray the Germanic roots of \\nModern English. “Mappemounde” also mimics the Old English use of \\nvivid metaphorical compounds, called kennings , to replace simple nouns: \\n“gleeword” ( gliwword , “entertaining-word”) rather than “song,” “breast-\\nhoard” instead of “thoughts.” For the Anglo-Saxon scop (“bard”), kennings \\ndisplayed poetic talent and aided the oral transmission of verse. Birney \\nimitated their bardic practice. By combining words derived from Old Eng -\\nlish, he created “whalehall” ( hwael  + heall ) along with its wealth of associa -\\ntions no longer obvious in the more prosaic “sea.”\\nAlso reminiscent of Old English verse are the poem’s alliteration and \\nrhythmic pattern.

Such obvious caesurae  (or pauses) are \\nused by editors of Old English poetry to emphasize that every line is actu -\\nally a combination of two short phrases, each with its own rhythm and \\ntwo stressed syllables. The scop joined these phrases when he alliterated \\nthe sound beginning one or more of their stressed syllables: “ shiptamed” \\nand “ soft,” “ gullgraced” and “ glidings.” By inserting central caesurae and \\neliminating the punctuation that distinguished his Strait of Anian  version \\n(where the line read “shiptamed, gullgraced, soft to our glidings”), Birney \\ndeliberately recast “Mappemounde” in a typography unfamiliar to the \\nnon-specialist and made the poem look as strange as it sounds. Yet its very \\n“foreignness” is key to its heritage. Old English might as well be a foreign \\nlanguage, and Anglo-Saxon poetry not only was meant to be heard but \\nwas composed and transmitted orally (Birney 1972, 85; Alexander 1966; \\nBessinger 1974, 587-88).\\nNor did Birney stop there. In theme and content “Mappemounde” \\nrecalls such classics of Old English literature as Beowulf , The Wanderer , \\nand The Seafarer.  Birney’s nadders  conjure up the fire-breathing, treasure-\\nhoarding dragons in Germanic literature, like the one Beowulf slays in \\nthe oldest extant Anglo-Saxon poem ( Beowulf, 2000-3187, in Jack 1994; see \\nRaver 2000). Birney’s “wanderer” and his ill-fated “pledges” evoke the \\nspeaker of The Wanderer , a man forced to sea after the deaths of lord and \\nkin. Birney’s “seafarer” and “whalehall” allude to The Seafarer, whose pro -\\ntagonist crisscrosses the hwaelweg (“whale-route”), far from his loved ones \\nand bitter in breosthord  (lines 55-63: see Alexander 1966, 90-105; Crossley-\\nHolland 1982, 47-52). Like The Wanderer and The Seafarer , “Mappemounde” \\nimagines the sea voyage—with its isolation and terror, its loneliness and \\nawe—as a poignant metaphor for life’s journey.\\nBirney’s title, however, is not Anglo-Saxon. The medieval word mappe -\\nmounde  appears six centuries after the composition of Beowulf  and three \\ncenturies after William the Conqueror installed a French-speaking aris -\\ntocracy on English soil. In fact, when the word was first recorded near the \\nend of the fourteenth century, the royal court still spoke Anglo-French.3 \\nBirney picked this Middle English word, in part, because Chaucer—the \\nfocus of Birney’s scholarly work—may have been the first to write it in \\nEnglish.

Here are the opening lines of Chaucer’s lyric poem, “To Rose -\\nmounde”:4\\nMadame, ye ben of al beautè shryne\\nAs fer as cercled is the mappemounde;...\\nMappemounde  is one of eleven words that Chaucer rhymes with \\n“Rosemounde,” the name he gives to the poem’s unidentified beloved \\nin line 15. “To Rosemounde” is a light-hearted ballade  about courtly \\nlove modeled on the French forms Chaucer preferred for his shorter \\npoems (Davies 1963, 42-43; Reeves 1970, 157-58). Though the speaker \\ndeclares undying love in the face of his beloved’s thrice-remarked indif -\\nference (“thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce”: lines 8,16,24), he cannot \\nhelp also comparing his passion to a fish wallowed  in sauce (“...pyk \\nwalwed in galauntyne”: line 17). Birney had catalogued some of that \\npoem’s whimsical qualities in his essay “The Beginnings of Chaucer’s “’Mappemounde’ imagines the \\nsea voyage—with its isolation \\nand terror, its loneliness and \\nawe—as a poignant metaphor \\nfor life’s journey.”\\n“The medieval word\\nmappemounde  appears six \\ncenturies after the composition \\nof Beowulf  and three centuries \\nafter William the Conqueror \\ninstalled a French-speaking \\naristocracy on English soil.”', metadata={'source': '/home/berk/Downloads/pkpadmin,+529-2711-1-CE.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

It may, therefore, have been his intent to \\ncontrast “Mappemounde” ironically with one of its inspirations: “To \\nRosemounde” couldn’t differ more from Birney’s melancholy, heavily \\nstressed verses.\\nBirney clearly chose the word mappemounde for its cartographic impli -\\ncations. To use the words of the Chaucerian editor, Walter Skeat, Rose -\\nmounde is the shrine of all beauty “as far as the map of the world ex -\\ntends” (Skeat [1899] 1952, 549). Writing in the second half of the fourteenth \\ncentury, Chaucer imagined the earth that was portrayed in contemporary \\nworld maps—an island “cercled” by the ocean/sea (cf. Tomasch 1992). \\nHistorians call such maps mappaemundi , “maps of the world,” which is the \\nplural form of the medieval Latin mappa mundi (du Cange 1954, 5:255).  Ap-\\nproximately 1100 mappaemundi survive of those made in Europe between  \\nthe fifth and the mid-fifteenth centuries. Some are little more than sketches \\nof a “T-O” shaped world: they show the earth as an ocean-embraced circle \\nof land (“O”) divided by the cross-like intersection (“T”) of the Mediterra -\\nnean Sea with the Don (Tanais) and Nile rivers forming the boundaries of \\nthe three known continents: Asia, Africa, and Europe. Other mappaemundi  \\nare adorned with hundreds of names, pictures, and legends. Still others \\nportray the earth divided into five (later seven) zones, with frigid polar \\nregions, temperate zones, and a central uninhabitable belt at the equator \\nknown as the perusta zona  (“the burnt up zone”). Most represent the world \\nas a Christian allegory, featuring prominent figures from the Old and New \\nTestaments alongside characters from classical mythology and ethnog -\\nraphies.

Pietro Vesconte, the earliest chartmaker \\nknown to us by name, worked in Venice. On four of the early fourteenth-\\ncentury atlases ascribed either to him or to Perrino Vesconte, portraits \\nof saints illuminate the corners of the portolan charts.9 (The portolano,  or \\nearly nautical chart, with its geographical accuracy and usefulness for both \\nnavigation and trade, its distinctive windroses and network of intersecting \\nrhumb lines, is now treated separately from the mappamundi . In the thir -\\nteenth and fourteenth centuries, however, the term mappa mundi embraced \\nboth allegorical world maps and practical sea charts based on compass \\nreadings. [Woodward 1987, 287; Campbell 1987, 439]) There is also a \\nfascinating anonymous 1390 Venetian atlas, which pictures the authors \\nof the gospels in the corners of at least one of its portolan charts (Mollat \\nand Roncière 1984, fig.10 and 204). Each evangelist appears as one of the \\nsix-winged, many-eyed creatures from the Book of Revelation. In the Bible, \\nthey stand beside God’s throne proclaiming his eternal glory (Revelation \\n4:7, in [Bible] 1973):\\nthe first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, \\nthe third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living \\ncreature like a flying eagle.\\nOn the chart, each saint presides over one of the earth’s four corners, and \\neach holds a scroll bearing his name (Woodward 1987, 336).\\nThe figures on this chart help us read the 1452 mappamundi  of the \\nVenetian cosmographer, Giovanni Leardo, who incorporated portolan \\nrhumb lines into his world map (Campbell 1987, 379 n.71).

From their ships nearby, three \\ncowled monks look on anxiously (Mollat and Roncière 1984, fig.28; Soucek \\n1992, 269-272 and fig.14.7).

His marriage to Esther withstood his ambivalence and love-affairs \\nuntil 1977, three decades after his return from the war. By that time, Birney \\nhad discovered in Wailan Low the ideal companion for the final quarter \\ncentury of his long life (Cameron 1994, 518-570; “...o many and many/ and \\nhappiest years”: Birney 1975, 2:180).\\nIn the meantime, “Mappemounde” was published in The Strait of \\nAnian, a collection whose name derives from the strait much sought \\nafter from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries (Nunn 1929; James \\nFord Bell 1956; Keating 1970, esp. 51-67; Gough 1988) .19 Now identified \\nwith the Bering Strait, the Strait of Anian provided the western access \\nto the Northwest Passage, a northern water route thought to link the \\nriches of Asia with the ports of Europe while bypassing the enormous \\nand largely unexplored landmass in between. Birney refers to this strait \\ntwice in his 1948 collection. The first time is in his epigraph, a quote from \\nThomas Blundeville’s description of the circumnavigation of the globe \\nby Sir Francis Drake from 1577 to 1580.

Drake had reason for optimism: the strait had been \\nmapped in 1562 by Giacomo Gastaldi. And a year before Blundeville’s \\naccount was published, the Dutch cartographer Cornelis de Jode came \\nout with a detailed and seemingly authoritative map entitled Quivirae \\nRegnum cum aliis versus Boream  (Figure 9, page 73).

Although de \\nJode’s depictions of the Strait of Anian and Northwest Passage are highly \\noptimistic, Birney’s poems focus on the failure of early explorers to navi -\\ngate such treacherously icy waters. For Birney, the Strait of Anian became \\na metaphor for Canada’s isolation from the rest of the world. In “Pacific \\nDoor,” Birney summarizes eighteenth-century attempts to cross from the \\nStrait of Anian into the Northwest Passage (Birney 1948, 37; cf. Oxford \\nAtlas 1997, 140-141):\\nHere Spaniards and Vancouver’s boatmen scrawled\\nthe problem that is ours and yours,\\nthat there is no clear Strait of Anian\\nto lead us easy back to Europe,\\nthat men are isled in ocean or in ice\\nand only joined by long endeavour to be joined.\\nWith his usual irony, Birney calls the second half of The Strait of Anian \\n“One World” (41-84) and fills it with war poems. The world war was one \\nway of shattering Canada’s physical and cultural isolation.\\nAn inveterate wanderer, Birney retained his interest in exploration, \\ngeography, and maps throughout his long career. “Pacific Door” would \\nbe followed by “Trial of a City” (Birney 1952 [1957], published later as The \\nDamnation of Vancouver , Birney 1977a), “Vitus Bering” (1953), “Captain \\nCook” (1958-59), “Giovanni Caboto/John Cabot” (1965),  and “Conrad \\nKain” (1974). His fascination with geography is evident in the way he \\narranged the poems for his collection about the city of Vancouver, Trial \\nof a City (Birney 1952, esp. 47-57); in the titles and subjects of poems like \\n“North of Superior” (1946), “Alaska Passage” (1960), “Perth, Australia, I \\nLove You” (1968); and in later collections like Ice Cod Bell or Stone  (Birney \\n1962) or Near False Creek Mouth (Birney 1964), both of which describe his \\ninternational ports of call from the 1950s on. Near False Creek Mouth  is not \\nonly filled with place-name titles (“Guadelupe,” “Machu Picchu,” “Epi -\\ndaurus”) but includes four playful sketch maps illustrating the places \\nBirney wrote about during his many travels. The only place these maps \\nshare is “False Creek Mouth,” another name for Vancouver, emphasizing \\nthat city’s—and its poet’s—connection with the rest of the world.\\nNot until the late 1960s, however, did Birney return to maps as the \\nsubject of his verse (Birney 1971; 1975, 2:159). Always the experimenter, \\nBirney chose an entirely different format from the linear, sonnet-like ap -\\npearance of “Mappemounde.” This time he turned to visual poetry and \\ncreated poems shaped  like maps.

And shortly after he won the Canada Council Medal \\nin 1968 “for distinguished achievement over an extended period” (Aich -\\ninger 1979, 44), Birney composed “Hare Krishna.” Read aloud, it sounds \\nlike the mantra chanted by the sect’s members to purify their souls.

Regarding these revisions, the following do not affect the poem’s \\nmeaning: the replacement of “NO” by “No” (line 1) or of “the dear \\nface-charm” by “the brave picture-faces” (line 8); the fact that “in” \\nends line 9 instead of beginning line 10. More significant are two \\nchanges discussed below: Birney’s replacement of “that” by “which” \\n(line 3) and his typographic alterations. The typography Birney \\nadopted in Selected Poems 1940-1966 and later collections remains \\ncontroversial (Birney 1966, ix; Nesbitt 1974, 10, 142-43, 153-54, 159-\\n60, 212-13).\\n3. The French word mappemonde  derives from the medieval Latin mappa \\nmundi. The forms mappemond and mappemonde also appear in Middle \\nEnglish ( OED  1989). For French spellings prior to 1500, see Tobler \\nand Lommatzsch 1963, 5:1102-1103, s.v. mapemonde  (with alterna -\\ntives mappamonde and mappemonde ) as well as “ mapemont ” (with \\nmapemund ). Birney helped his Canadian readers translate his title \\n“Mappemounde” by reminding them of their high-school French \\n(Birney 1972, 84).\\n4. The quote comes from an edition familiar to Birney: Skeat [1894-\\n1900] 1926-54, 1:389. Skeat, who first published the poem and gave it \\na title, notes that the late fifteenth-century manuscript containing the \\nuntitled poem actually uses the spelling mapamonde . The current edi -\\ntion spells the word mapamounde (Benson 1987, 649).  Chaucer’s con -\\ntemporary, John Gower, also uses the word in his Confessio Amantis : \\n“And sette proprely the bounde/ Aftre the forme of Mappemounde” \\n(3.102: OED  1989).\\n5. At the time when Birney was composing “Mappemounde,” the \\ngreat compendium of medieval maps was Miller (6 vols., 1895-98). \\nAlso important were works by A.E.

Park Street\\nButte, MT 59701Hillshading renders a surface with a three-dimensional appearance us -\\ning shades of gray. Although shades appear as continuous tones, they \\nmust undergo a halftoning process for use with most computer output \\ndevices. This process generally uses one pattern of black and white pix -\\nels for each shade of gray, while attempting to make patterns associated \\nwith black and white pixels as difficult to detect as possible.\\nThe method described in this paper adds aspect information to hillshad -\\ned maps with oriented halftones. Twelve orientations of clustered-dot \\nordered dithers represent 30° intervals of aspect. Additionally, dithering \\nmatches sixteen shades of gray associated with analytical hillshading, \\nwith each interval representing 16 of 256 shades of gray. This process \\nallows pattern and gray tone representations of the surface simultane -\\nously.\\nillshading is a cartographic technique that has been used to repre -\\nsent continuous surfaces with shades of gray for hundreds of years \\n(Imhof, 1982; Horn, 1981; Horn, 1982; Robinson et al. 1995). The tonal \\nvariations on the resulting map give the impression of a three-dimensional \\nsurface (Clarke, 1995; Horn, 1981; Horn, 1982). This effect is based on \\nchiaroscuro, the interplay of light and shading commonly used by Renais -\\nsance artists (Burrough and McDonnell, 1998; Horn, 1981; Horn, 1982). To \\nachieve this effect, the cartographer selects a direction of illumination and \\nmakes surface elements most directly illuminated bright and those more \\nobliquely illuminated increasingly dark. Such hillshading uses the Lam -\\nbertian assumption of an ideal diffuse reflector approximated by a matte \\nsurface. A brightness value is calculated for each surface element based on \\nthe cosine of the   angle θ between the selected illumination vector and the \\nnormal vector for each surface element.\\nHistorically, cartographers working with hillshading focused on the \\nmethods of producing this effect, but also needed to concern themselves \\nwith the technologies for reproducing the maps. The hachure method \\ndevised by Lehmann (1799) used fine lines drawn in the direction of steep -\\nest topographic gradient. It was widely used because copper engraving, a \\npopular reproduction technique for maps at the time, could not reproduce \\ncontinuous shades of gray, but worked well for black lines on white paper \\nto approximate grayscales. Only after the patent of the halftone screen \\nin 1865 and the crossline screen in 1869, did lithographs that allowed the \\ncontinuous variations of shades of gray become a commercial success \\n(Horn, 1981; Horn, 1982). \\nComputer cartographers working with hillshading also necessarily \\nconcerned themselves with reproduction methods. Before plotters could \\noutput continuous shades of gray, researchers automated two methods \\ndevised by Tanaka (1932 and 1950) that used contour lines to approxi -\\nmate the hillshading effect.

Finally computer cartographers were able to reproduce hill -\\nshading maps with continuous shades of gray with new gray tone plotters \\n(Peucker et al., 1974). \\nWith the ease of computer-based hillshading methods and the avail -\\nability of continuous tone plotters, hillshaded maps have been produced \\nand reproduced widely. From a cartographic perspective, current hill -\\nshading methods are the solution to surface rendering with the Lamber -\\ntian assumption. From a computer graphics perspective, however, part \\nof the reproduction method could be exploited to add information to the \\nmap. Printed maps with hillshading are not continuous tones of gray, but \\nare composed of black halftones on white paper that give this illusion. \\nThe method developed and discussed here assigns different orientations \\nto halftone patterns based on the aspect of the surface, matches shades of \\ngray based on the hillshading values, and combines pattern and shading \\nin a single hillshaded map. \\nVariations in tone have been used to create the hillshading effect greater \\nthan or the same resolution as the data being mapped. Hillshading greater \\nthan the resolution of the data frequently used black point symbols on a \\nwhite background, while hillshading at the resolution of the data fre -\\nquently used continuous shades of gray.\\nEckert (1921) used dots of various sizes to create a hillshaded map of \\nthe Lake Lucerne region of Switzerland (see Figure 1 ).

These macroscopic dots proved dif -\\nficult to draw, overloaded the map, and never found popular use (Imhof, \\n1982).\\nVertical hachures were used widely in the first half of the 19th century. \\nLehmann (1799) quantified a method by which large-scale hachures could \\nbe drawn in the direction of slope, with the thickness of the hachure be -\\ning proportional to the steepness of the slope. The hachure method with \\nan oblique illumination effect reached its cartographic and artistic apex \\nwith the Swiss “Dufour” maps (see Figure 2 ). The first editions of these 25 \\nhachure maps were published at 1:100,000 by the Swiss Federal Office of \\nTopography between 1845 and 1865 (See http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/\\nmaps/ak/tk.htm for more detail). \\nThe process was computer-automated by Yoeli (1985) (see Figure 3 ). \\nBoth manual and computer hachure methods were based on a contour \\nframework. Although relating hachures to the resolution of the data is dif -\\nficult, it would be fair to say that the hachures were less detailed than the \\ncontours from which they were created. Kennelly and Kimerling (2000) \\nautomated a method for creating small-scale hachure maps based on regu -\\nlarly spaced points instead of a contour framework (see Figure 4 ). These \\nhachures are well above the resolution of the data, with Digital Elevation \\nModel (DEM) grid cells first aggregated into 3x3 grid cells, then each new \\ngrid cell represented by a single hachure.\\nHorizontal hachures can also create tonal variations associated with \\nhillshading (Imhof, 1982). Instead of lines in the direction of maximum \\nslope, horizontal hachures are lines in the direction of no change in eleva -\\ntion (see Figure 5 ). These horizontal form lines are similar to contours, \\nFigure 3.

Horizontal \\nhachures were often used in the 19th century, but are not commonly used \\ntoday.\\nHillshading with tonal variations at the resolution of the data includes \\nboth manual and computer automated methods. Manual hillshading, like \\nhachuring, often was based on a contour framework, with shades of gray \\ninterpreted at and between contour lines (Imhof, 1982; Yoeli, 1959). This \\nmethod created striking portrayals of topography when used by skilled \\ncartographers (Imhof, 1982). \\nComputer-based hillshading often operates on a DEM, with the angle \\nand resulting shade of gray calculated for each grid cell. Although a \\nstraightforward process (Peucker et al., 1974), the earliest development of \\nthe method was nearly thwarted due to technological constraints. Yoeli \\n(1965) used an early computer technology to calculate hillshading values \\nfor a 25x25 topography grid, but had no way of outputting his results \\nwithout a gray tone plotter. Undaunted, he screened a gray wedge of ten \\nclasses, cut the screen into 2 cm. squares, and created a mosaic based on \\nthe computed hillshading value of each grid cell. Next, Yoeli (1966) related \\nthe light intensity calculated for hillshading with the density of black \\ndots a white background. Finally, Yoeli (1967) was able to use a computer-\\ncontrolled electronic typewriter to print and overprint desired characters \\ninto each cell of a hillshaded grid (see Figure 6 ). In this manner, he could \\nmatch 20 shades of gray from dot densities to the brightness values associ -\\nated with hillshading.\\nInherent differences stand out between methods greater than or the \\nsame resolution as the data. Hachuring results in strong patterns associat -\\ned with the form of the topography. Hachuring, however, results in a map \\nthat only approximates values calculated for hillshading with the Lam -\\nbertian assumption. Hillshading results in smooth variations in shades of \\ngray. Patterns (e.g. hachures, contours) have been overprinted on hillshad -\\ning, but cartographers have never attempted to use hillshading itself to “Patterns (e.g. hachures,\\ncontours) have been overprinted \\non hillshading, but\\ncartographers have never\\nattempted to use hillshading \\nitself to create patterns.”\\nFigure 5.

This project describes how this can be implemented with \\ndigital halftones. \\nIn the field of computer graphics, shading or rendering includes illu -\\nmination models for diffuse reflectors that are identical to cartographic \\nhillshading techniques using the Lambertian assumption (Shirley, 2002; \\nHearn and Baker, 1994; Zhou, 1992; Foley et al., 1990; Rogers, 1985). Car -\\ntographers and computer graphic professionals, however, often render \\ndifferent sorts of data. Cartographers render detailed elevation data, \\nwhich reveals small scale geometry and large scale detail of the landscape. \\nComputer graphic professionals often use geometric shapes approximated \\nwith polygonal surfaces (Shirley, 2002; Hearn and Baker, 1994; Foley et al., \\n1990). Resulting edges at surface boundaries are smoothed using a num -\\nber of interpolated shading methods, such as Gouraud shading. (Hearn \\nand Baker, 1994; Foley et al., 1990; Rogers, 1985). Cartographers also have \\nused Gouraud shading to smooth edges of topographic models (Weibel \\nand Heller, 1991).\\nSurface details often are added to computer-rendered graphics, as \\n“smooth, uniform surfaces [appear] in marked contrast to most of the \\nsurfaces we see and feel.” (Foley et al., 1990, 741). Two general methods are \\nused to map texture onto a smooth surface, one a mathematical mapping \\nfunction and the other a perturbation function (Rogers, 1985). Two dimen -\\nsional texture mapping uses a coordinate transformation to map a pattern \\nor image onto a surface (Shirley, 2002; Foley et al., 1990). The resulting \\ngraphic continues to appear geometrically smooth and may not follow \\npatterns associated with principles of shading. \\nBump mapping overcomes this problem by adding irregularities to \\nthe surface before shading. Foley et al. (1990) explain; “A bump map is an \\narray of displacements, each of which can be used to displacing a point on \\na surface a little above or below that point’s actual position” (744). In prac -\\ntice, bump mapping perturbs the surface normal vector before shading is \\ncalculated using mathematical functions, including ones that are random \\nor periodic (Hearn and Baker, 1994). In this manner, correctly shaded tex -\\nture can be added to a surface.\\nPatterns can be added to smooth surfaces with texture and bump \\nmapping, but no new information is added from the original surfaces. \\nPatterns based on data can be displayed on rough topographic surfaces, \\nadding new information from the original surface. One method for adding \\ntexture is through the use of derivatives of the DEM, such as fractals (e.g. \\nClarke, 1988). McCullagh (1998) points out one issue with using a regional \\nstatistical value on individual cells; “The roughness introduced into the \\nlandscape may be statistically correct and visually effective but will not be \\nlocationally accurate” (102).COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND\\nHALFTONES\\n“Surface details often are added \\nto computer-rendered graphics, \\nas ‘smooth, uniform surfaces \\n[appear] in marked contrast to \\nmost of the surfaces we see and \\nfeel.’”\\n“Patterns can be added to \\nsmooth surfaces with texture \\nand bump mapping, but no new', metadata={'source': '/home/berk/Downloads/pkpadmin,+529-2711-1-CE.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n",

The \\nlocal variable is the aspect direction, the same variable used in hachure \\nmaps. The detailed texture is created with digital halftones.\\nUlichney (1987) states “Digital halftoning, also referred to as spatial \\ndithering, is the method of rendering the illusion of continuous-tone \\npictures on displays that are capable of producing only binary picture \\nelements.” (xiii). Halftoning may be necessary for video displays that \\nare implemented with frame buffers that limit gray scale capability, and \\nare almost always necessary for raster images with computer hard copy \\ndevices (Ulichney, 1987). \\nHalftoning may use ordered or random dithers, with ordered dithers \\nallowing control over the dithering pattern. Ordered dithers can be clus -\\ntered or dispersed. Clustered dithers are used in this project, as “a clus -\\ntered-dot halftoning mimics the photoengraving process used in printing, \\nwhere tiny pixels collectively comprise dots of various sizes” (Ulichney, \\n1987, 3). This type of halftoning is referred to as the “classical”, graphic \\narts, or printer’s screen (see Figure 7 ).\\nThis classical monochrome screen is often oriented at a 45° angle from \\nthe edge of the video screen or paper. This orientation is generally consid -\\nered to result in the least visual disturbance or a minimum in perceptual \\nsensitivity (Robinson et al., 1995; Ulichney, 1987). Sometimes a pattern is \\ndesirable. Computer graphic professionals uses clustered-dot line screens \\nto create a halftone special effect (Ulichney, 1987). The linear dithering \\nresulting in one pattern across the entire image, but adds no additional \\ninformation to the display.\\nComputer graphic professionals have manipulated the orientation of \\nindividual halftones in various ways. Sloan and Wang (1992) oriented \\nhalftones based on the information contained in grayscale images. They “Halftoning may use ordered \\nor random dithers, with ordered \\ndithers allowing control over \\nthe dithering pattern.”\\n“Sometimes a pattern is\\ndesirable.”\\nFigure 7.

Their rationale is that this method \\nprovides “an extra channel that we can use to convey information about \\nthe image” (149). \\nA more difficult problem is orienting halftones base on three dimen -\\nsional (3D) geometries in virtual scenes. Sloan and Wang’s (1992) research \\nbegins with a grayscale image, devoid of information on the 3D geometry \\ncaptured in the image. Saito and Takahashi (1990) began with a 3D com -\\nputer graphics model and stored orientation information in a series of \\ngeometric buffers (g-buffers). Information on many different geometric \\ncomponents of a virtual scene is often stored in this manner. This method \\nwas modified by Haeberli (1990) to orient the pattern of brushstrokes for \\nvirtual 3D scenes. Veryovka and Buchanan (1999) used g-buffers to ori -\\nent halftones on an image of a 3D model based on its geometry. Haeberli \\n(1990) and Veryovka and Buchanan (1999) used complex raytracing algo -\\nrithms to define the geometry of the objects in the virtual scene.\\n The method outlined in this paper includes geometric information \\nderived from a 2.5 dimensional surface, one in which each grid cell has a \\nunique z-value. A hillshaded image can contain multiple grid cells of one \\nshade of gray that represent any or all aspect directions. An example is a \\nmap of a conical hill under vertical illumination. The entire hill would be \\nshaded with the same tone of gray. With a constant gray value, no pattern \\nwould be added to this hillshaded image with Sloan and Wang’s (1992) \\nmethod. The only geometric information needed to orient halftones to \\ncreate patterns similar to hachure maps is the aspect of each grid cell. The \\nmethodology for creating such maps is described below.\\nThis project computes hillshading from DEMs and reclassifies the re -\\nsulting 256 shades of gray into 16 equal interval classes.

The \\nnumber of black pixels (1-16) matches the classes of gray associated with \\nhillshading. The patterns of the pixels are based on the aspect direction. \\nNorth-south and east-west aspect patterns are not used, as the resulting \\nlinear patterns are too distracting. Identical patterns are used for aspect \\ndirections of northeast and southwest, etc. Thus only 96 unique bitmap \\npatterns are constructed.\\nOrdered clustering of individual halftones can approximate vertical or \\nhorizontal hachuring using the same bitmaps. The arrangements for vari -\\nous orientations to create a vertical hachuring effect are shown in Figure \\n9 and those  for a horizontal hachuring effect are shown in Figure 10 .

The NPS produces tourist maps for 388 parks in \\na system spanning a large swath of the Earth’s surface from the Caribbean \\nto Alaska to the South Pacific, and which is visited by nearly 300 million \\npeople each year. Many park visitors are inexperienced map readers and \\nnon-English speakers. In our ongoing effort to make NPS maps accessible \\nto everyone, the design of NPS maps has become less abstract and increas -\\ningly realistic, particularly in the depiction of mountainous terrain and \\nnatural landscapes (Figure 1). Many of the techniques discussed herein are \\nborrowed from or inspired by 3D mapping (Patterson, 1999). However, \\nthe scope of my paper deals exclusively with plan mapping—a format \\nthat has received scant attention in the digital era in regard to abstract vs. \\nrealistic depiction compared to the 3D world. It is also the format in which \\nthe majority of NPS maps will continue to be made.\\nCartographic Realism\\nAs one would expect, the term “realism” occurs frequently throughout \\nthis paper. It is important to define the meaning of this term in the carto -\\ngraphic context before continuing. Webster’s New World Dictionary  defines \\nrealism, in the artistic sense, as:\\nThe picturing in art and literature of people and things as it is thought \\nthey really are, without idealizing.\\nApplying this definition to maps is problematic because all maps (and \\neven many remotely sensed images) are idealized representations of the \\nEarth and are inherently abstract. On the other hand, most of us would \\nagree that some maps appear more realistic and are more intuitively \\ncomprehensible than others. For example, a shaded relief map with terrain \\nrepresented by softly modulated light and shadows appears more realistic \\nthan a contour map with a multitude of isolines connecting points of equal \\nINTRODUCTION\\n“In our ongoing effort to make \\nNPS maps accessible to\\neveryone, the design of NPS \\nmaps has become less abstract \\nand increasingly realistic,\\nparticularly in the depiction of \\nmountainous terrain and\\nnatural landscapes.”', metadata={'source': '/home/berk/Downloads/pkpadmin,+529-2711-1-CE.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",

The ersatz realism one sees on a map—which I will call \\n“cartographic realism”—is not reality, but is instead a graphical represen -\\ntation. The snow on the ground outside my window as I write this is real. \\nThe white coloration representing snowy mountain peaks on the topo -\\ngraphic map of the Alps on my wall is cartographic realism. This being a \\npaper about map design, use of the term “realism” throughout the follow -\\ning discussion is solely intended in the context of “cartographic realism.”\\nThe move to more cartographically realistic map design by the NPS has \\nbeen gradual and unplanned. Using graphical software applications that \\nallow sophisticated designs to be routinely produced, which were previ -\\nously only imagined, the NPS has found itself inextricably drawn toward \\nusing greater realism. Cartography is not alone in this trend. Faux realism \\nhas become ubiquitous in almost every graphical medium today from \\ntele-vision to print publishing to multimedia. For example, the graphical \\nuser interface (GUI) of Mac OS X, the virtual environment in which I am \\nnow immersed, uses soft drop shadows, transparency, pulsing 3D buttons, \\nand a soothing “aqua” desktop to hide its complex Unix underpinnings \\nfrom the casual computer user. The enhanced realism of NPS maps has \\na similar aim—sparing the park visitor from the off-putting technical as -\\npects of conventional cartography with a map user interface (MUI) that is \\nmore user-friendly and that simultaneously delivers relevant and accurate \\ninformation. \\nWhen depicting maps with cartographic realism, we are constrained \\nby the finite limits of graphical methods—only so much is possible on a \\n2D surface—and our pre-conceived ideas of how the Earth appears from \\nabove. Geographic, graphic, and  perceptual reality are often at odds with \\none another and must be reconciled by the cartographer in order to design \\na map with realistic characteristics.\\nWith increased cartographic realism, map use becomes more a matter \\nof looking rather than reading. Compared to conventional maps, real -\\nistic maps are, undeniably, dumbed down—users have to grapple with \\nfewer abstractions, and intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to \\nthink abstractly. However, by avoiding the use of abstract symbolization, \\nrealistic maps have the potential to communicate more efficiently to a \\ngreater number of users.

Among the most spectacular and enduring efforts in cartographic \\nrealism are those made by 20th century artist/cartographers.\\nArtist/cartographers\\nIn the 1950s Hal Shelton, an employee of the USGS and an accomplished \\nfine artist, painted small-scale plan maps of the US to be used by air \\ntravelers for general orientation. Shelton’s maps were unique in that they \\nportrayed land cover—forest, agricultural land, and built-up areas—in \\ncombination with shaded relief to mimic what passengers would actual -\\nly see on the ground from an aircraft. On Shelton’s maps land cover was \\nportrayed more prominently than the terrain. Many of Shelton’s original \\npieces, still under copyright protection, are  housed at the US Library of \\nCongress where they may be viewed by appointment only.\\n Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Eduard Imhof’s painted \\nmap of Walensee, Switzerland is perhaps the most famous example of \\nearly cartographic realism ever produced (Figure 2). Imhof’s piece is \\nnoteworthy for its artistic use of strong colors to model topography, \\nwhich is combined with less dominant land cover. Deep reds are used \\nat higher elevations to give mountain peaks visual loft, blue-gray haze \\nsuppresses the lowlands, and cast shadows thrown by steep mountains \\nextend onto the aqua green surface of Walensee. Holding true to the \\nSwiss cartographic preference, cliffs receive considerable textural detail \\nwhile agricultural fields and forests are depicted with flat color. Drain -\\nages and light colored roads are slightly incised into the landscape, as a \\nviewer would expect them to be when viewed from above.\\nThe Walensee map was painted experimentally to showcase the \\nunrestrained application of art in the cartographic context. The result -\\ning masterpiece is on permanent display at the Swiss Alpine Museum in \\nBerne. However, despite the accolades, Imhof was opposed to the idea \\nthat his Walensee map would serve as a model for general cartographic \\ndesign.\\nAccording to Imhof\\n“What is achieved by such painting experiments?

Recognizing that \\nfew other people possessed the artistic ability and geographic expertise to \\npaint maps such as Walensee, that the technology of the day was inad -\\nequate for the mass reproduction of painted maps, and that cartographic \\nemployers were not demanding such products, his admonitions were, \\nit seems, intended to keep impressionable students from wasting their \\ntime.

A snapshot of the Earth from above, aerial photographs \\nare the ultimate in geo-realism providing cartographers with a means to \\ndeliver pure and uncensored geographic information to the reader (Keller, \\n2000).

Despite these advantages, outside of the engineering, surveying, \\nand scien-tific fields, aerial photograph maps have not caught on for gen -\\neral cartogra-phic use.

Clouds, which tend to persist \\nover mountainous regions, and their shadows obscure the ground \\nbelow. \\nNo visual hierarchy - From above, a park visitor center and a nearby \\nsewage treatment facility might appear equally significant.\\nTemporal sensitivity - For better or worse, aerial photographs show \\nus a single moment in time. By the time the map is made, an image \\ntaken of a farm field could have been replaced with suburban homes, a \\nglacier could have melted, or a winter-bare deciduous forest may be in \\nleaf.\\nNotwithstanding these shortcomings, aerial photographs have been \\nused to produce realistic maps. Most innovative, perhaps, are the South \\nPacific island maps, including Aitutaki, Cook Islands, produced by the \\nNew Zealand Department of Survey and Land Information during the \\n1970s. On the Aitutaki map, terrestrial areas are shown in a competent \\nand conventional cartographic manner. However, the depiction of water \\nis unique (Figure 2).

To help see whether the merged \\nphysical elements on a realistic map are in graphical balance, try viewing \\nthe map on screen at large and small scales.

The key \\nto achieving aquafication is to remember that lines are seldom found in \\nnature—therefore, all casings are removed from oceans, lakes, and double-\\nline rivers. Drainages are made to appear more natural by tapering widths \\nbased on their relative size and direction of flow—a tedious technique that \\nis a throwback to our pen and ink cartographic forebears. However, it is \\nrelatively easy to taper drainages in a program like Adobe Illustrator by \\nusing custom brushes. A library of custom brushes can be built to repre -\\nsent various thin-to-thick tapering progressions, which are easily applied \\nto stream vectors (Nelson, 2001).\\nIn the aquafication process, all hydrographic features, including water \\nbodies and tapered drainages, should be assigned the same color (avoid \\nusing pure cyan) and rasterized as a single layer in Photoshop. Once in \\nPhotoshop, subtle adjustments can be applied to give the hydrography \\na more realistic appearance. By adjusting the opacity, blending mode, \\nand color of the layer, hydrography can be given just the right amount of \\nprominence compared to other physical landscape elements. As a final \\ntouch, sun glints (a form of modulation) can be added to water bodies and \\nrivers by applying light tone with the airbrush tool and a big soft brush.\\nAs a general rule, water bodies are blank space on maps. They are a \\nconvenient dumping ground for legends, text notes, and photographs \\nthat pertain to terrestrial areas, usually the prime focus of the map. The \\nsecondary status of water bodies on maps, and their constantly changing \\nappearance in nature, also provides cartographers with a blank canvas for \\napplying realistic special effects not applicable to terrestrial areas where \\nconflicts with primary information are a concern. Special effects on water \\nsurfaces are more than artistic embellishments. They can improve map \\ncommunication. For example, a sun glint strategically placed near a shore -\\nline park visitor center can be used to subconsciously draw the reader’s \\nattention to that area. Other special effects can imply environmental \\nphenomena. By showing a wave pattern only on the choppier windward \\nshore, the leeward and windward shores of a tropical island can be dif -\\nferentiated (Figure 8).\\nMore precise mapping is possible with artistic embellishments on wa -\\nter. For example, a partially submerged reef can be mapped, albeit indi -\\nrectly,  by showing its effect on water—breaking surf—by  transferring an \\nimage of the surf from a registered aerial photograph. The NPS has used a \\nsimilar technique to map rapids on the Potomac River at Great Falls Park, \\nVirginia.“Drainages are made to\\nappear more natural by tapering \\nwidths based on their relative \\nsize and direction of flow—a \\ntedious technique that is a \\nthrowback to our pen and ink \\ncartographic forebears.”\\n“Special effects on water\\nsurfaces are more than artistic \\nembellishments.

Popularized \\nby the ocean floor maps published by National Geographic, this style of \\nbathymetric depiction is being used increasingly on NPS maps to show \\nconnectivity between underwater and terrestrial environments.\\nTexture substitution\\nThe textures found on aerial photographs contain a wealth of rich visual \\ncues for differentiating land cover. Forest canopies often appear hum -\\nmocky, rocky areas can be rough and fractured, and agricultural fields \\nappear as a patchwork of mottled tones. However, except for some water \\nfeatures, transferring these textures directly to a map is not feasible be -\\ncause of the inherent flaws in aerial photographs discussed earlier.\\nA technique known as texture substitution can be used to partially cir -\\ncumvent this problem. Here’s how it works. Using an aerial photograph \\nor satellite image (registered to a base map), land cover is carefully delin -\\neated as Photoshop selections with pixel-level precision. These selections \\nare then transferred to the base map, where they are filled with generic \\nland cover textures cloned from the aerial photograph, or even from \\nother photographs (Figure 9). The result is a reconstituted final product \\nthat selectively brings the best traits of aerial photographs—their often \\neye-catching beauty, realism, rich textures, and tiny details that readers \\nfind so fascinating—to the familiar and readable format of a map. Maps \\ncreated with texture substitution appear more like a picture of a detailed \\nphysical model than an aerial photograph. On aerial photographs tex -\\ntures begin coalescing at scales smaller than 1:50,000 (Imhof, 1982). This \\nproblem can be solved by substituting large-scale textures onto a small-\\nscale map. The results of this procedure look surprisingly plausible and \\nnatural.\\nThe selection of appropriate generic textures to substitute is a critical \\nconsideration for preventing a map from turning into a grossly inaccu -\\nrate caricature. Substituted textures must accurately characterize the land \\ncover being depicted, with just enough variability to look authentic. How -\\never—and this is extremely important—the variability must also be small \\nand inconsequential in nature so it doesn’t mislead readers with false \\ninformation. Substituted textures should be completely avoided on very \\nlarge-scale maps, because at these scales the generalized textures would be \\na blatantly incorrect replacement for actual detail.\\nSubstituted textures look most natural when used inside complex land “Maps created with texture \\nsubstitution appear more like \\na picture of a detailed physical \\nmodel than an aerial\\nphotograph.”\\n“The selection of appropriate \\ngeneric textures to substitute is \\na critical consideration for\\npreventing a map from turning \\ninto a grossly inaccurate\\ncaricature.”Figure 8.

Alternat -\\ning textured/nontextured areas produces a tessellation that compliments \\nthe texture pattern as a whole. With some classes of land cover, such as \\nforests, a slight amount of 3D embossment (known as bump mapping in \\n3D applications) applied to forest polygons themselves suggests a for -\\nest edge rising above adjacent non-forested areas (Nighbert, 2000). The \\norientation of the tiny highlights and shadows on an embossed 3D tex -\\nture must synchronize with the illumination and shadows on the shaded \\nrelief—usually from an assumed light source in the upper left. In general, \\ntextures should be used sparingly on a map. Keep in mind that not every \\ntype of land cover warrants or is suitable for texturized portrayal. On NPS \\nmaps land cover textures are mostly used to depict forests, glaciers, lava \\nflows, and rocky peaks. Other classes of land cover are left untextured to \\ngive the reader’s eyes a place to rest.\\nWhen aerial photograph textures are not suitable for texture substitu -\\ntion, manual touchups and synthetic texturing (both done in Photoshop) \\nare the options of last resort. If these techniques must be used they should \\nbe printed lightly and applied to polymorphous features, such as sand \\ndunes or glaciers, where cartographic accuracy is elusive under the best of \\ncircumstances (Figure 10).\\nIlluminated relief\\nThe illuminated relief technique enhances shaded relief  combined with \\nland cover textures. Normally, combining shaded relief and land cover \\ntextures on a map involves graphical compromise. Together these ele -\\nments are not as effective as when they stand alone, especially shaded \\nrelief, which has a wispier appearance compared to land cover textures.\\nWhen illuminated relief is used, supplemental illumination and shad -\\nowing enhance topographic modeling by also lightening and darkening \\nland cover textures. The technique uses adjustment layers and alpha \\nchannels to manipulate the hue, saturation, and brightness of selected \\nareas on a shaded relief map. By using multiple adjustment layers that \\nbuild upon one another, complimentary illumination and shadow colors \\ncan be made gradually more intense at higher elevations to suggest al -\\npenglow (Figure 11).

This seems even \\nmore certain since the reader of \\nthe CD-atlas is only a button-click \\naway from the extremely conve -\\nnient state map of Oregon that has \\nalready been mentioned. While \\nthe printed atlas suffers from lack \\nof such a handy reference map, \\nespecially among the thematic \\nmaps, the CD-atlas provides this \\nin a superb fashion.\\nThe importance of being able \\nto cross-reference or compare \\nmaps was briefly discussed in \\nthe review of the printed atlas. \\nSince this is so fundamental \\nin a reader’s use of an atlas, it \\ndeserves a second mention.  In \\na conventional atlas, cross-refer -\\nencing or map-comparison often \\nbecomes an onerous exercise of \\npage number memorization, page \\nmarking, or repeatedly return -\\ning to the Table of Contents . The \\nCD-atlas however, provides tools \\nto considerably increase the ease \\nand efficiency with which cross-\\nreferencing or map-comparison is \\nperformed. The CD-atlas furnish -\\nes easy-to-find buttons for click -\\ning and quickly moving from one \\nmap to another. One can simply \\nuse the “clickable” Table of Con -\\ntents  however the designers have \\nadded an extra tool very useful \\nfor moving between maps. There \\nis a button at the top of the screen \\nlabeled “ Compare ”. This button al -\\nlows the reader to instantly switch \\nbetween two different maps with \\na single click. Cross-referencing \\nor comparison by use of maps has \\nnever been quicker or easier.\\nThe maps contained in the CD-\\natlas maintain the high graphic \\nquality of the maps found in the \\nprinted version. Of course the \\nfinest lines and most subtle color \\ndifferences found on the printed \\npage suffer somewhat when \\nviewed on a computer monitor and can differ markedly when \\nviewed on different monitors. \\nHowever given the limitations of \\nRGB monitor viewing, the maps \\nremain graphically pleasing and \\nseemed impressively similar to \\nthe printed versions. Quality \\ncontrol appears to have been care -\\nfully conducted. While comparing \\nseveral maps between the CD-at -\\nlas and the printed atlas, only one \\nmap in the CD-atlas was found to \\nbe missing a type label that was \\nincluded on the same map in the \\nprinted atlas.\\nThe contents of the second \\ndisk in the CD-atlas set include \\naerial photos from selected loca -\\ntions in Oregon. These locations \\nare: Alsea Bay, Astoria, Belknap \\nCrater, Crater Lake, Hells Canyon, \\nHood River, Mount Hood, Port -\\nland, Smith Rock, Umatilla, and \\nWarner Valley. No rationale was \\nvisible to explain the inclusion of \\nphotography from these specific \\nlocations. One could perhaps \\nassume this photography covers \\nspecific physical or environmental \\nfeatures in Oregon. Since they are \\nfrom different regions in the state, \\nperhaps the purpose of the photos \\nis simply to demonstrate Oregon’s \\necological diversity.

Initially, \\nusing the two versions of the Atlas \\nof Oregon  did not alter this prefer -\\nence though it was soon evident \\nthat the Atlas of Oregon CD-ROM  \\npossesses distinct advantages \\nwhen compared to its printed \\ncounterpart. One of its advantages \\nlies simply in the fact that such a \\nwell-produced atlas exists on CD-\\nsized media. The convenience of \\nhaving the Atlas of Oregon  on two \\ncompact disks provides a tremen -\\ndous payoff in terms of the den -\\nsity of good quality information provided per amount of storage \\n“real estate” required. \\nThe more the CD-atlas was \\nused, however, the more its inter -\\nactive qualities became valued. \\nThis aspect makes using the atlas \\nboth enjoyable and educational.  \\nIn the opinion of this reviewer, \\nthis is the most important way in \\nwhich the CD-atlas complements \\nthe printed version of the Atlas \\nof Oregon . It allows the reader to \\nmanipulate images, view the data \\nat varying scales, easily compare \\nbetween maps and even print base \\nmaps for one’s own use. These \\ncapabilities are what carry the atlas \\nbeyond merely being a reference \\ntool to truly serving in the capacity \\nof an educational tool. \\nGiven the quality of the CD-\\natlas, not many suggestions for \\nimprovement come to mind, \\nhowever there are two minor \\nitems. Flexibility in the use of this \\natlas would be increased with the \\ninclusion of a “minimize” option \\nto allow users to more conve -\\nniently use other software while \\nkeeping the CD-atlas active. Using \\nthe Alt-Tab  or Command-Tab  keys \\n(Alt-Tab  for Windows, Command-\\nTab for Macintosh) enables read -\\ners to alternate between different \\nprograms, however a minimize \\nbutton located on the CD-atlas \\nscreen would be helpful. A second \\nsuggestion would be to place the \\n“Next Section ” button in exactly the \\nsame position throughout the atlas. \\nThis would allow the reader the \\noption of quickly paging through \\nthe different sections of the atlas \\nwith his or her eyes remaining on \\nthe contents of the pages rather \\nthan having to shift to the top of \\nthe monitor to relocate a button \\nbecause its location has shifted. \\nSince the “ Previous Section ” button \\ndoes appear to retain its position, \\nthe reader would have the option \\nof going to the end of the material \\ncontained on each disk and quickly \\npage toward the beginning.

My \\nintroduction to Winchester came \\nin the same delightfully surpris -\\ning manner in which he spins his \\ntales. I literally stumbled across \\nWinchester’s work one night in a \\ndimly lit Nepali tea-house, trip -\\nping over a well-worn travelers \\ncopy of his remarkable descrip -\\ntion of the creation of the  Oxford \\nEnglish Dictionary . As I carried that \\nchronicle throughout my travels, \\nWinchester’s eye for historical \\ndetail and penchant for anecdote \\ncaused me to wonder, “Why I had \\nnever heard this story before?” Re -\\nally, a mental institutionalite wrote the definitions quoted at keynote \\nspeeches and in term papers across \\nthe world? That book, The Professor \\nand the Madman , succeeds in bring -\\ning vivid life to the creation of one \\nof the most important, and com -\\nmonly taken-for-granted, books of \\nour time. \\nWinchester’s most recent opus, \\nThe Map that Changed the World , \\nsucceeds in much the same way. \\nHere, Winchester replaces the \\ndictionary for something far more \\nfamiliar to me, a geologic map. I \\nmust admit my bias here; I was \\nexcited to read this book from \\nthe moment it landed (again by \\nchance) in my hands. If Win -\\nchester’s writing had me excited \\nabout something as mundane as \\nthe dictionary, how could I not like \\nthis new tale about the creation \\nof the world’s first true geologic \\nmap?

While this \\nwonderful cartographic element of \\nthe story is not to be understated, \\nthe true complexity and bril -\\nliance of the map is found through \\nWinchester’s riveting account of its cartographer, William Smith \\n(1769-1839). The artistic mastery \\nand scientific endeavor contained \\nwithin the map was entirely the \\nproduct of this singular man. \\nWinchester’s tale follows William \\nSmith from the depths of a debt -\\nors prison, back to his childhood \\nfossil digging days in Oxfordshire, \\nacross his young apprenticeship \\nas a canal digger, and arrives at \\nhis peaceful retirement by the sea \\nin Scarborough.

       " Document(page_content='62 Number 43, Fall 2002  cartographic perspectives    \\nAs Winchester continues, we \\nfind that this natural-born “revo -\\nlutionary” talent first sprouted \\nwhen Smith was a young lad in \\nOxfordshire. Upon the death of \\nhis father when he was eight, \\nSmith was brought up on his \\nuncle’s farm.  He began to notice \\npeculiar stones around the farm, \\nstones that looked like remnants \\nof living creatures.  While there \\nwere others that had made the \\nsame observation, the idea of fos -\\nsils was heresy to late 18th century \\nEngland. Nevertheless, he was \\nacutely aware that others silently \\nheld the belief that fossils were \\nactually remnants of animals that \\nexisted long before the genesis \\nof the world set by the biblical \\nscholar James Ussher. As Win -\\nchester points out, scientists of the \\nlate 17th and 18th centuries were \\nbeginning to erode the certitude \\nof biblical knowledge. This slowly \\nchanging atmosphere of scientific \\ninquiry allowed the young Smith \\nto accept and examine the fossils \\nhe found in his boyhood home. \\nSmith’s study of fossils and their \\ngeographical distribution had \\nbegun and became the foundation \\nfor his great map.\\nWhile Smith is now credited \\nas the father of modern geology, \\nWinchester’s account characteriz -\\nes Smith as a geographer through \\nand through. The young Smith \\nlanded his first job, a surveyor, \\nthrough his recognized talents \\nfor observation and geometry. \\nSmith was schooled in the ways \\nof surveying and cartography, \\nand quickly became respected in \\nthe field. In a seemingly pre-des -\\ntined coincidence, his first major \\njob was a commission to survey a \\npath for the Somerset coal canal. \\nSmith’s love of fossils had found \\na practical application, and his \\nnew home of Rugborne Farm, \\nSomerset is now christened “the \\nbirthplace of geology.” It was his \\ngeographical training and talent \\nthat led Smith to the discoveries \\nthat marked the birth of geology on Rugborne Farm. Winchester \\nnotes his “uncanny ability to \\nperceive the spatial geometry of \\nthe world beneath his feet” (p. 89). \\nWhile deciding which coalfields \\nto put on the canal, Smith became \\naware of a possible order to the \\nspatial arrangement of the coal \\nstrata. He noticed that the strata \\nabove and below the coal layers \\nwere remarkably similar across \\nthe different mines in the area and \\nbegan to sketch three-dimensional \\nmaps of what he saw and learned \\nfrom the miners. Smith’s major \\nbreakthrough was connecting his \\nknowledge of fossils to the stratig -\\nraphy he saw beneath his feet. He \\nfound that fossils were a way to \\nmake sense of the strata, and most \\nimportantly, be able to unmistak -\\nably map their distribution. Geol -\\nogy was born, and the map had its \\nkey theoretical foundation.\\nSmith’s brilliance can be ap -\\npreciated from many different \\ndisciplines and trades.

More -\\nover, he was quickly becoming \\na cartographer of note. Smith’s \\nventures into cartographic design \\narose from a necessity to display \\nthree-dimensional geologic strata \\nvariations across the land surface. \\nHis use, choice, and manipulation \\nof color led to the cartographic \\nprinciples of geologic maps that \\nare still visible today. Smith de -\\nfined a color for each strata, and \\nmany of the color schemes have \\ncarried over into modern geologic \\nmaps. Smith’s cartography was as \\ncreative and brilliant as the geol -\\nogy for which he is more readily \\nknown. His original geologic map \\nnot only made use of hand-ap -\\nplied color, but he applied the \\ncolor in a way to be darker where \\nthe strata outcrop occurred, then fade in color towards the next \\noutcrop. \\nWhile Smith excelled in many \\ndisciplines, all his work was \\ndirected at the creation of the \\nmap. The canal building, irriga -\\ntion projects, and cartography \\nwere all directed at collecting and \\nmanipulating stratigraphic data to \\nproduce the map. Smith’s desire \\nto produce the map was un -\\nquenchable. He was fully aware of \\nthe profoundly important nature \\nof his research, and spent his life’s \\nwork in pursuit of the map. His \\nextensive travels, professional \\nconnections, and cartography \\nbegan to bring Smith a sizeable \\nincome.

Just as his \\nwork was challenging socially \\naccepted norms, Smith’s life was \\ndefying his born societal class. His \\ntravels now also frequently took \\nhim to London, where he acquired \\nanother mortgage on a flat.

The proximate causes \\nfor Smith’s demise are many and \\ngive this great man an all too \\nhuman character. He lost his job \\nwith the canal company after a tiff \\nwith his boss, his wife became ill, \\nand he had two mortgages to pay. \\nHowever, it is strikingly obvi -\\nous to the reader, and to Smith \\nhimself, that after publishing \\nthe map, he should never want \\nfor money again.
